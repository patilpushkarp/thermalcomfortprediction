# HOME AUTOMATION – THERMAL COMFORT PREDICTION AND LIGHT CONTROL USING INTERNET OF THINGS

## About Project
India is a tropical country due to which it experience a large variation in temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. Even different places in India experience may not experience the same weather at the same time. About 50% of the electricity consumption in India is due to buildings, and about 60% of the electricity consumption in buildings is due to cooling. Hence substantial amount of energy and capital resources is spent every year in cooling to achieve a thermally comfortable environment in buildings. Maintaining a healthy indoor climate is crucial to prevent health hazards to the occupants. A healthy indoor environment also improves productivity at work. A prior knowledge of the occupant’s thermal comfort level can help to control how much energy is to be spent in cooling, thus limiting the energy consumption as per requirement. Prediction of thermal comfort can therefore, not only maintain a favorable indoor climate but also aid in reducing energy consumption. It can bring about an optimal balance between energy use and thermal comfort- a vital objective of smart city buildings. Smart city buildings also aims to incorporate wireless technologies so as to control various devices. This proposed project uses neural network to predict thermal comfort of a user and also allows to control lighting devices using Internet of Things technology.
This project performs the following tasks: 
    1. Predict the comfort of the users in the specified room using sophisticated machine learning & algorithms.
    2. Initiate appropriate action based on the predictions i.e. control of Air-conditioning device using Internet of Things technology.
    3. Lighting devices will also be controlled over the internet.
